Founded in 2015, The Conrad Press Ltd., based in the UK, has so far (as of September 2021) published close to 250 books and has a reputation in the industry for looking after its writers and for excellent book production standards. 


We are a general publisher; publishing most genres including fiction, non-fiction, memoirs, autobiography, poetry and works of personal philosophy. 

We have a subsidy publishing model; for an ebook up to 90,000 words in length we charge an author contribution of £895 but £697 of this consists of our disbursements to our cover designer and typesetter. 

Authors can also choose for the book to be published as a print book, in which case they pay our printer/distributor, Clays, direct, we make no mark-up on print costs. 

We offer authors a 100 percent royalty on ebook and print book sales until the author contribution and print costs have been paid back to the author and after that there is a 50:50 split of profits between the author and The Conrad Press. 


We also have a specialist division that introduces authors to our extensive Hollywood contacts at no extra cost.



WE ALSO OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE AND COMPETITIVELY-PRICED GHOSTWRITING SERVICE IF YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR BOOK WRITTEN BY US, BUT ONLY YOUR NAME WOULD BE ON IT.

We are led by founder and principal James Essinger, who is himself a professional writer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Essinger
