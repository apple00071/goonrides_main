the whole world was sliding in chrysolite from under my feet. I followed 
with the others round the corner to arrive at the brink of the canon: we 
had to climb up a nearly perpendicular ascent to begin with, for the ground 
rises more than the river drops. Stately pine woods fringe either lip of 
the gorge, which is ¡ª the Gorge of the Yellowstone.</p><p>Thus parted the 
two burghers. The glover retired to his bed, and, it is to be supposed, to 
rest. The lover was not so fortunate. His bodily frame easily bore the 
fatigue which he had encountered in the course of the night, but his mind 
was of a different and more delicate mould. In one point of view, he was 
but the stout burgher of his period, proud alike of his art in making 
weapons and wielding them when made; his professional jealousy, personal 
strength, and skill in the use of arms brought him into many quarrels, 
which had made him generally feared, and in some instances disliked. But 
with these qualities were united the simple good nature of a child, and at 
the same time an imaginative and enthusiastic temper, which seemed little 
to correspond with his labours at the forge or his combats in the field. 
Perhaps a little of the hare brained and ardent feeling which he had picked 
out of old ballads, or from the metrical romances, which were his sole 
source of information or knowledge, may have been the means of pricking him 
on to some of his achievements, which had often a rude strain of chivalry 
in them; at least, it was certain that his love to the fair Catharine had 
in it a delicacy such as might have become the squire of low degree, who 
was honoured, if song speaks truth, with the smiles of the King of 
Hungary¡¯s daughter. His sentiments towards her were certainly as 
exalted as if they had been fixed upon an actual angel, which made old 
Simon, and others who watched his conduct, think that his passion was too 
high and devotional to be successful with maiden of mortal mould. They were 
mistaken, however. Catharine, coy and reserved as she was, had a heart 
which could feel and understand the nature and depth of the armourer¡¯
s passion; and whether she was able to repay it or not, she had as much 
secret pride in the attachment of the redoubted Henry Gow as a lady of 
romance may be supposed to have in the company of a tame lion, who follows 
to provide for and defend her. It was with sentiments of the most sincere 
gratitude that she recollected, as she awoke at dawn, the services of Henry 
during the course of the eventful night, and the first thought which she 
dwelt upon was the means of making him understand her feelings.</p><p>Mrs 
Muscat lowered her blond eyelashes and swayed her neat head just 
perceptibly from side to side, with a sincere desire to be moderate in her 
expressions, not withstanding any shock that facts might have given 
her.</p><p>&quot;It will say,&quot; cried Mrs Barnett with enthusiasm, &quot;it will say 
that you have done your duty, that you are not responsible for the caprices 
of nature, which is ever more powerful than man. It will understand that 
you could not foresee what has happened, for it was beyond the penetration 
of the most far-sighted man, and it will know that it owes the preservation 
of the whole party to your prudence and moral courage.&quot;</p><p>Frank¡¯s 
face flushed angrily on the instant.</p><p>Of Japan at Ten Hours¡¯ 
Sight, containing a Complete Account of the Manners and Customs of its 
People, a History of its Constitution, Products, Art, and Civilisation, and 
omitting a Tiffin in a Tea-house with O-Toyo</p><p>¡®Good-bye,¡¯ 
said Lady Lufton, and turning herself to her table she began to arrange her 
papers. Fanny had never before left Framley Court to go back to her own 
parsonage without a warm embrace. Now she was to do so without even having 
her hand shaken. Had it come to this, that there was absolutely to be a 
quarrel between them ¡ª a quarrel for ever?¡¯</p><p>¡®I don¡¯
t know,¡¯ thought Michael, ¡®if I have pride, but I haven¡¯t 
got a career.¡¯ He followed slowly upstairs, and for some little time 
stood in the doorway of his dressing-room. But no sound came from upstairs

<p><font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: silver" color="silver"><p>It is obvious that this was merely a case of robbing Peter 
to pay Paul. There was no real clearing up of the outstanding debt. It was 
the intention of the schemers to make it possible for the financial 
politicians on the inside to reap the same old harvest by allowing the 
certificates to be sold to the right parties for ninety or less, setting up 
the claim that there was no market for them, the credit of the city being 
bad. To a certain extent this was true. The war was just over. Money was 
high. Investors could get more than six per cent. elsewhere unless the loan 
was sold at ninety. But there were a few watchful politicians not in the 
administration, and some newspapers and non-political financiers who, 
because of the high strain of patriotism existing at the time, insisted 
that the loan should be sold at par. Therefore a clause to that effect had 
to be inserted in the enabling ordinance.</p><p>¡®But there is no see 
vacant,¡¯ said Mrs Grantly.</p><p>¡®If there be such inability, 
it is all with you.¡¯</p><p>&quot;Very well,&quot; replied Cowperwood, quietly, 
getting up. &quot;We needn¡¯t talk about it any more now. Your time is 
nearly up, anyhow.&quot; (Twenty minutes was supposed to be the regular 
allotment for visitors.) &quot;Perhaps you¡¯ll change your mind 
sometime.&quot;</p><p>¡®I cannot say, Ludovic, that she is possessed of all 
that you should seek in a wife.¡¯ Such was her answer.</p><p>&quot;He has 
been a long time away from England, sir; and it¡¯s by no means easy to 
trace him, on that account. I have been to the young woman, named Phoebe in 
your statement, to find out what she can tell me about him. She¡¯s 
ready enough, in the intervals of crying, to help us to lay our hands on 
the man who has deserted her. It¡¯s the old story of a fellow getting 
at a girl¡¯s secrets and a girl¡¯s money, under pretence of 
marrying her. At one time, she¡¯s furious with him, and at another 
she¡¯s ready to cry her eyes out. I got some information from her; 
it¡¯s not much, but it may help us. The name of the old woman, who has 
been the go-between in the business, is Mrs. Sowler ¡ª known to the police 
as an inveterate drunkard, and worse. I don¡¯t think there will be 
much difficulty in tracing Mrs. Sowler. As to Jervy, if the young woman is 
to be believed, and I think she is, there¡¯s little doubt that he has 
got the money from the lady mentioned in my instructions here, and that he 
has bolted with the sum about him. Wait a bit, sir, I haven¡¯t done 
with my discoveries yet. I asked the young woman, of course, if she had his 
photograph. He¡¯s a sharp fellow; she had it, but he got it away from 
her, on pretence of giving her a better one, before he took himself off. 
Having missed this chance, I asked next if she knew where he lived last. 
She directed me to the place; and I have had a talk with the landlord. He 
tells me of a squint-eyed man, who was a good deal about the house, doing 
Jervy¡¯s dirty work for him. If I am not misled by the description, I 
think I know the man. I have my own notion of what he¡¯s capable of 
doing, if he gets the chance ¡ª and I propose to begin by finding our way to 
him, and using him as a means of tracing Jervy. It¡¯s only right to 
tell you that it may take some time to do this ¡ª for which reason I have to 
propose, in the mean while, trying a shorter way to the end in view. Do you 
object, sir, to the expense of sending a copy of your description of Jervy 
to every police-station in London?&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right, sir! don¡¯t 
blame me; I¡¯m not ashamed of the Rules. And now, if I am to speak, I 
must speak seriously on a serious subject; I must begin with our religious 
principles. We find our Christianity in the spirit of the New Testament ¡ª 
not in the letter. We have three good reasons for objecting to pin our 
faith on the words alone, in that book. First, because we are not sure that 
the English translation is always to be depended on as accurate and honest. 
Secondly, because we know that (since the invention of printing) there is 
not a copy of the book in existence which is free from errors of the press, 
and that (before the invention of printing) those errors, in manuscript 
copies, must as a matter of course have been far more serious and far more 
numerous. Thirdly, because there is plain internal evidence (to say nothing 
of discoveries actually made in the present day) of interpolations and 
corruptions, introduced into the manuscript copies as they succeeded each 
other in ancient times. These drawbacks are of no importance, however, in 
our estimation. We find, in the spirit of the book, the most simple and 
most perfect system of religion and morality that humanity has ever 
received ¡ª and with that we are content. To reverence God; and to love our 
neighbour as ourselves: if we had only those two commandments to guide us, 
we should have enough. The whole collection of Doctrines (as they are 
called) we reject at once, without even stopping to discuss them. We apply 
to them the test suggested by Christ himself: by their fruits ye shall know 
them. The fruits of Doctrines, in the past (to quote three instances only), 
have been the Spanish Inquisition, the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, and the 
Thirty Years¡¯ War ¡ª and the fruits, in the present, are dissension, 
bigotry, and opposition to useful reforms. Away with Doctrines! In the 
interests of Christianity, away with them! We are to love our enemies; we 
are to forgive injuries; we are to help the needy; we are to be pitiful and 
courteous, slow to judge others, and ashamed to exalt ourselves. That 
teaching doesn¡¯t lead to tortures, massacres, and wars; to envy, 
hatred, and malice ¡ª and for that reason it stands revealed to us as the 
teaching that we can trust. There is our religion, sir, as we find it in 
the Rules of the Community.&quot;</p><p>¡®I did not wish to marry him, or 
to be rich.¡¯</p><p>And when he was well gone ¡ª absolutely out of 
sight from the window ¡ª Lucy walked steadily up to her room, locked the 
door, and then threw herself on the bed. Why ¡ª oh! why had she told such a 
falsehood? Could anything justify her in a lie? was it not a lie ¡ª knowing 
as she did that she loved him with all her loving heart? But, then, his 
mother! and the sneers of the world, which would have declared that she had 
set her trap, and caught the foolish young lord! Her pride would not have 
submitted to that. Strong as her love was, yet her pride was, perhaps 
stronger ¡ª stronger at any rate during that interview. But how was she to 
forgive herself the falsehood she had told?</p><p>Felix chatted, that 
Esther might recover herself; but now Mrs Holt came back and 
apologised.</p><p>&quot;That¡¯s a nice way to talk to me, and a nice way to 
treat me!&quot; she exclaimed dramatically, rising and walking the short space ¡ª 
some two steps ¡ª that lay between the wall and the bed. &quot;I might have known 
that you were too young to know your own mind when you married me. Money, 
of course, that¡¯s all you think of and your own gratification. I 
don¡¯t believe you have any sense of justice in you. I don¡¯t 
believe you ever had. You only think of yourself, Frank. I never saw such a 
man as you. You have treated me like a dog all through this affair; and all 
the while you have been running with that little snip of an Irish thing, 
and telling her all about your affairs, I suppose. You let me go on 
believing that you cared for me up to the last moment, and then you 
suddenly step up and tell me that you want a divorce. I¡¯ll not do it. 
I¡¯ll not give you a divorce, and you needn¡¯t think 
it.&quot;</p><p>Then Felix leaned forward, that their lips might meet again, and 
after that his eyes roved tenderly over her face and curls.</p><p>&quot;Where 
are the ladies?&quot; he asked.</p><p>&quot;I think I do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you take me for 
a fool?&quot; Mrs. Farnaby went on. &quot;Do you think I don¡¯t know you better 
than you know yourself?&quot; She stepped up close to him; her voice sank 
suddenly to low and tender tones. &quot;If that last unlikely chance should turn 
out in my favour,&quot; she went on; &quot;if you really did meet with my poor girl, 
one of these days, and knew that you had met with her ¡ª do you mean to say 
you could be cruel enough, no matter how badly I behaved to you, to tell me 
nothing about it? Is that the heart I can feel beating under my hand? Is 
that the Christianity you learnt at Tadmor? Pooh, pooh, you foolish boy! Go 
back to Regina; and tell her you have tried to frighten me, and you find it 
won¡¯t do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yassah, I done tuck it.&quot;</p><p>¡®Sit down, sit 
down,¡¯ said Harold, as they entered the handsome, spacious library. 
But he himself continued to stand before a map of the county which he had 
opened from a series of rollers occupying a compartment among the 
bookshelves. ¡®The first question, Mr Jermyn, now you know my 
intentions, is, whether you will undertake to be my agent in this election, 
and help me through? There¡¯s no time to be lost, and I don¡¯t 
want to lose my chance, as I may not have another for seven years. I 
understand,¡¯ he went on, flashing a look straight at Jermyn, ¡®
that you have not taken any conspicuous course in politics; and I know that 
Labron is agent for the Debarrys.¡¯</p><p>&quot;Ten from six hundred!&quot; 
exclaimed Mrs Barnett. &quot;At this rate, it will take us three months to get 
to the American continent!&quot;</p><p>A call from Eviot summoned the attendants 
of the Prince, who had been sleeping on the staircase and hall, exhausted 
by the revels of the evening.</p><p>Snow, which soon became hardened, 
replaced the rain of the preceding days. A few more days of such cold and 
sledges could be used The little bay hollowed out of the cliffs of Cape 
Michael was partly filled with ice and snow, but it must not be forgotten 
that its calmer waters froze more quickly than those of the open sea, which 
were not yet in a satisfactory condition.</p><p>&quot;Only one, sir,&quot; said the 
man. &quot;The others are all dead. She¡¯s as good a girl and as pretty a 
girl as ever put on a petticoat ¡ª though I say it that shouldn¡¯t. 
Thank you kindly, sir. Good night!&quot;</p><p>Then said I: ¡®This is a 
special Sending. I have seen the City of Chicago.¡¯ And I went away to 
get peace and rest.</p><p></p><p>&quot;Meaning in your own, Conachar?&quot; said 
Simon.</p><p>&quot;Fear not, sir prior,&quot; said Douglas. &quot;I despise the childish 
boy too much to raise a finger against him. But I will return insult for 
insult. Here, any of you who love the Douglas, spurn me this quean from the 
monastery gates; and let her be so scourged that she may bitterly remember 
to the last day of her life how she gave means to an unrespective boy to 
affront the Douglas.&quot;</p><p>¡®I shall come to you before dinner,¡¯
 said Lady Meredith; ¡®and if I can bring you good tidings, I shall 
expect you to come back here with me. It is out of the question that I 
should go away from Framley leaving you and my mother in enmity with each 
other.¡¯ To this Mrs Robarts made no answer; and in a very few minutes 
afterwards she was in her own nursery, kissing her children, and teaching 
the elder one to say something about papa. But, even as she taught him, the 
tears stood in her eyes, and the little fellow knew that everything was not 
right. And there she sat till about two, doing little odds and ends of 
things for the children, and allowing that occupation to stand as an excuse 
to her for not commencing her letter. But then there remained only two 
hours to her, and it might be that the letter would be difficult in the 
writing ¡ª would require thoughts and changes, and must needs be copied, 
perhaps, more than once. As to the money, that she had in the house ¡ª as 
much, at least, as Mark now wanted, though the sending of it would leave 
her nearly penniless. She could, however, in case of personal need, resort 
to Davis as declared by him.</p><p>Hobson had thought the same, and was 
glad to find that his companions agreed with him in the 
matter.</p><p>Lieutenant Hobson suggested that they should do 
so.</p><p>Esther had felt some relief in hearing from her father that Felix 
had insisted on doing without his mother¡¯s presence; and since to Mrs 
Holt¡¯s imagination, notwithstanding her general desire to have her 
character inquired into, there was no greatly consolatory difference 
between being a witness and a criminal, and an appearance of any kind 
¡®before the judge¡¯ could hardly be made to suggest anything 
definite that would overcome the dim sense of unalleviated disgrace, she 
had been less inclined than usual to complain of her son¡¯s decision. 
Esther had shuddered beforehand at the inevitable farce there would be in 
Mrs Holt¡¯s testimony. But surely Felix would lose something for want 
of a witness who could testify to his behaviour in the morning before he 
became involved in the tumult?</p><p>&quot;D¡¯you mean, then,&quot; said Sir 
Lawrence, gravely, &quot;that I¡¯ve got to tell Yule there¡¯s no 
defence?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Anything wrong, Dinny?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Even so, my son,&quot; said the 
Carthusian, &quot;and I doubt whether their malice will suffer me to remain in 
this country. I did but speak a few sentences about the superstition and 
folly of frequenting St. Fillan¡¯s church, to detect theft by means of 
his bell, of bathing mad patients in his pool, to cure their infirmity of 
mind; and lo! the persecutors have cast me forth of their communion, as 
they will speedily cast me out of this life.&quot;</p><p>¡®There is an 
expression about her forehead that is full of poetry,¡¯ said Fanny to 
her husband.</p><p>&quot;Keep Miss Dinny¡¯s taxi, Blore.&quot;</p><p>A few 
moments sufficed to renew the atmosphere of the house, and all unhealthy 
vapours were quickly dispersed by the introduction of a pure and refreshing 
current of air.</p><p>&quot;What amount of money does he owe you?&quot;</p><p>¡®
Well, my dear, that¡¯s better than the hounds being mad about him. But 
talking of hounds, Frank, how badly they manage their foxes at Chaldicotes! 
I was out hunting all one day ¡ª¡¯</p><p>In obedience to the 
Lieutenant¡¯s order, Joliffe brought some reindeer-venison, which the 
poor creatures devoured with greedy avidity; but the young woman who had 
answered in English behaved with greater refinement, and watched Mrs 
Barnett and the women of the fort without once removing her eyes from them. 
Presently noticing the baby in Mrs Mac-Nabs arms; she rose and ran up to it,
 speaking to it in a soft voice, and caressing it tenderly.</p><p>¡®
Only that I should have thought that you would have been too guarded to 
have ¡ª have cared for any gentleman till ¡ª till he had shown that he cared 
for you.¡¯</p><p>His best friends in the financial world were by now 
convinced that his was a sinking ship. A student of finance once observed 
that nothing is so sensitive as money, and the financial mind partakes 
largely of the quality of the thing in which it deals. There was no use 
trying to do much for a man who might be going to prison for a term of 
years. Something might be done for him possibly in connection with the 
governor, providing he lost his case before the Supreme Court and was 
actually sentenced to prison; but that was two months off, or more, and 
they could not tell what the outcome of that would be. So Cowperwood¡¯
s repeated appeals for assistance, extension of credit, or the acceptance 
of some plan he had for his general rehabilitation, were met with the 
kindly evasions of those who were doubtful. They would think it over. They 
would see about it. Certain things were standing in the way. And so on, and 
so forth, through all the endless excuses of those who do not care to act. 
In these days he went about the money world in his customary jaunty way, 
greeting all those whom he had known there many years and pretending, when 
asked, to be very hopeful, to be doing very well; but they did not believe 
him, and he really did not care whether they did or not. His business was 
to persuade or over-persuade any one who could really be of assistance to 
him, and at this task he worked untiringly, ignoring all others.</p><p>I 
heard her last night, poor thing, talking and grinding her teeth in her 
sleep; and I went into her room to try if I could quiet her, in the usual 
way, by putting my cool hand on her forehead, and pressing it gently. (The 
old doctor says it¡¯s magnetism, which is ridiculous.) Well, it 
didn¡¯t succeed this time; she went on muttering, and making that 
dreadful sound with her teeth. Occasionally a word was spoken clearly 
enough to be intelligible. I could make no connected sense of what I heard; 
but I could positively discover this ¡ª that she was dreaming of our guest 
from America!</p><p>&quot;Yes. I¡¯m not sure that you oughtn¡¯t to 
deny it for her sake.&quot;</p><p>The vagaries of passion! Subtleties! Risks! 
What sacrifices are not laid willfully upon its altar! In a little while 
this more than average residence to which Cowperwood had referred was 
prepared solely to effect a satisfactory method of concealment. The house 
was governed by a seemingly recently-bereaved widow, and it was possible 
for Aileen to call without seeming strangely out of place. In such 
surroundings, and under such circumstances, it was not difficult to 
persuade her to give herself wholly to her lover, governed as she was by 
her wild and unreasoning affection and passion. In a way, there was a 
saving element of love, for truly, above all others, she wanted this man. 
She had no thought or feeling toward any other. All her mind ran toward 
visions of the future, when, somehow, she and he might be together for all 
time. Mrs. Cowperwood might die, or he might run away with her at 
thirty-five when he had a million. Some adjustment would be made, somehow. 
Nature had given her this man. She relied on him implicitly. When he told 
her that he would take care of her so that nothing evil should befall, she 
believed him fully. Such sins are the commonplaces of the 
confessional.</p><p>His increasing anxiety will therefore be readily 
understood. The fine season was rapidly passing away. Another two months 
and the Arctic winter, with its bitter winds, its whirlpools of snow, and 
its long nights, would again set in.</p><p>When you have seen a burning 
mountain you begin to appreciate Japanese architecture. It is not solid. 
Every one is burned out once or twice casually. A business isn¡¯t 
respectable until it has received its baptism of fire. But fire is of no 
importance. The one thing that inconveniences a Jap is an earthquake. 
Consequently, he arranges his house that it shall fall lightly as a bundle 
of broom upon his head. Still further safeguarding himself, he has no 
foundations, but the cornerposts rest on the crowns of round stones sunk in 
the earth. The corner-posts take the wave of the shock, and, though the 
building may give way like an eel-trap, nothing very serious happens. This 
is what epicures of earthquakes aver. I wait for mine own experiences, but 
not near a suspected district such as the Burning Mountain.</p><p>&quot;I have 
heard rumors, Mr. Mollenhauer,&quot; he said, &quot;to the effect that some charge is 
to be brought against me as a partner with Mr. Stener in this matter; but I 
am hoping that the city will not do that, and I thought I might enlist your 
influence to prevent it. My affairs are not in a bad way at all, if I had a 
little time to arrange matters. I am making all of my creditors an offer of 
fifty cents on the dollar now, and giving notes at one, two, and three 
years; but in this matter of the city treasury loans, if I could come to 
terms, I would be glad to make it a hundred cents ¡ª only I would want a 
little more time. Stocks are bound to recover, as you know, and, barring my 
losses at this time, I will be all right. I realize that the matter has 
gone pretty far already. The newspapers are likely to start talking at any 
time, unless they are stopped by those who can control them.&quot; (He looked at 
Mollenhauer in a complimentary way.) &quot;But if I could be kept out of the 
general proceedings as much as possible, my standing would not be injured, 
and I would have a better chance of getting on my feet. It would be better 
for the city, for then I could certainly pay it what I owe it.&quot; He smiled 
his most winsome and engaging smile. And Mollenhauer seeing him for the 
first time, was not unimpressed. Indeed he looked at this young financial 
David with an interested eye. If he could have seen a way to accept this 
proposition of Cowperwood¡¯s, so that the money offered would have 
been eventually payable to him, and if Cowperwood had had any reasonable 
prospect of getting on his feet soon, he would have considered carefully 
what he had to say. For then Cowperwood could have assigned his recovered 
property to him. As it was, there was small likelihood of this situation 
ever being straightened out. The Citizens¡¯ Municipal Reform 
Association, from all he could hear, was already on the move ¡ª 
investigating, or about to, and once they had set their hands to this, 
would unquestionably follow it closely to the end.</p><p>It was necessary 
carefully to study the unexpected and novel situation in which the agents 
of the Company now found themselves, and Hobson did so with his chart 
before him.</p><p>¡®Good-bye, Miss Robarts. I wish I could make you 
understand how very highly I regard your conduct in this matter. It has 
been above all praise, and so I shall not hesitate to say when speaking of 
it to your relatives.¡¯ This was disagreeable enough to Lucy, who 
cared but little for any praise which Lady Lufton might express to her 
relatives in this matter. ¡®And pray,¡¯ continued Lady Lufton, 
¡®give my best love to Mrs Robarts, and tell her that I shall hope to 
see her over here very soon, and Mr Robarts also. I would name a day for 
you all to dine; but perhaps it will be better that I should have a little 
talk with Fanny first.¡¯</p><p>&quot;What! you coy it, my nymph of the 
highway?&quot; said the Prince, contemptuously. &quot;Know damsel, that one asks you 
a grace who is unused to denial.&quot;</p><p>Jean was the first to appear, Lady 
Cherrell having stayed to Communion, the General to count the offertory and 
Hubert to inspect the village cricket pitch. She found Dinny sitting by an 
old sundial in front of a bed of delphiniums. Having kissed her 
sister-inlaw, she stood and looked at her for quite a minute, before 
saying: &quot;Take a pull, my dear, or you¡¯ll be going into a decline, 
whatever that is.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I¡¯ve dusted the pictures, Annie. Keep the 
window and door open. I want it all to smell sweet. Can you do the room now?
&quot;</p><p>About this time a few animals were taken which had already assumed 
their winter furs, such as martens, polecats, blue foxes, and ermines. 
Marbre and Sabine had obtained leave from the Lieutenant to set some traps 
outside the enceinte. He did not like to refuse them this permission, lest 
they should become discontented, as he had really no reason to assign for 
putting a stop to the collecting of furs, although he knew full well that 
the destination of these harmless creatures could do nobody any good. Their 
flesh was, however, useful for feeding the dogs, and enabled them to 
economise the reindeer venison.</p><p>¡®But, mother, what if I brought 
you a wife that you do not approve?¡¯</p><p>Dinny nodded.</p><p>Before 
ten o¡¯clock all the travellers were crouching in the snow houses, in 
groups of two or three, each choosing congenial companions. Mrs Barnett, 
Madge, and Lieutenant Hobson occupied one hut, Thomas Black and Sergeant 
Long another, and so on. These retreats were warm, if not comfortable; and 
the Esquimaux and Indians have no other refuge even in the bitterest cold. 
The adventurers could therefore fearlessly await the end of the storm as 
long as they took care not to let the openings of their holes become 
blocked up with the snow, which they had to shovel away every half hour. So 
violent was the storm that even the Lieutenant and his soldiers could 
scarcely set foot outside. Fortunately, all were provided with sufficient 
food, and were able to endure their beaver-like existence without suffering 
from cold or hunger</p><p>¡®I know all about it,¡¯ said Lord
