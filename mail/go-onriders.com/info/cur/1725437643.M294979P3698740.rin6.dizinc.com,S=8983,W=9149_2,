My name is M.V. Naveen, and I am the Regional Manager at CAL-ON Industries
Ltd. Established in 1999 in Hyderabad, CAL-ON Industries has been committed
to delivering superior quality products, including electronic weighing
scale systems, battery-operated vehicles, solar-based products, power
electronics, and handheld (POS) devices. We currently operate from 12
offices across Hyderabad, Secunderabad, Vijayawada, Vishakapatnam,
Rajahmundry, Guntur, Thirupathi, Kurnool, Ongole, Khammam, Warangal, and

*We recently visited your website and were impressed with the services you
