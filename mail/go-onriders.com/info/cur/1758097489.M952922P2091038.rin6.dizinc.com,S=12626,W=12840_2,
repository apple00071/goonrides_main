Dear Valued Partners,

I would like to share some news regarding my professional journey within
Royal Enfield. After a rewarding tenure leading our collaborative efforts
with The Rentals and Tours team, I have transitioned to a new role within
the organization. This move allows me to explore fresh opportunities while
continuing to contribute to Royal Enfield's growth.

I want to express my deepest gratitude for the unwavering support,
partnership, and collaboration you have provided over the past two years.
Your insights, dedication, and enthusiasm have been instrumental in driving
our shared successes, and I am truly appreciative of the trust you have
placed in me.

To ensure a seamless continuation of our projects and initiatives, *Mr.
Yadav* has graciously assumed the role of the new primary contact for the
team. With his extensive experience and passion for excellence, I am
confident that he will carry forward our momentum with the same commitment
and vision. I kindly ask that you extend to Mr. @Yadhav N R
<zzyadhav@royalenfield.com>  (+91-8301009230) the same level of support and
collaboration that you have so generously offered me. I have no doubt that
together, you will achieve even greater milestones.

Thank you once again for being such outstanding partners. I look forward to
hearing about your continued successes and perhaps crossing paths in my new
capacity.

Warm regards,

*Ahammed Aslam*

*Dealer Development - S7*

Royal Enfield (A Unit of Eicher Motors Ltd.)

*M +91 9995321480*
