Hey *Go-Onriders. Com,*

I hope you are doing well.

I'm really sorry to bother you, and I know you are super busy, but I was
checking your *Go-Onriders. Com* and saw you have a good design and it
looks great, but *it's not ranking on Google and other major search
engines.*

I want your permission. I would like to send you a *"SEO report with
prices"* showing you a few things to greatly *improve these search results
for you.*

These things are not difficult, and my report will be very specific. It
will show you exactly what needs to be done to *move you up in the rankings
dramatically.*

I would really love the opportunity to work with you and your business, and
bring your *Go-Onriders. Com* to the top of Google=E2=80=99s list - the swe=
et spot
where you get *clicks and more business!*

Please let me tell you some of the techniques that I can use below to help
you get a *better ranking in google search:*










*1. Title Tag Optimizations are missing, I can add these to your site. 2.
Meta Tag Optimization descriptions are absent, I can add them too. 3.
Heading Tags Optimization - No problem getting those put in there. 4.
Targeted keywords are not placed into tags correctly. 5. Alt / Image tags
Optimization is not present - it would take me seconds to write these. *
We've got lots to do together
*to make you stand out! *
So, if you are interested then please type *=E2=80=9CEstimated timeline to =
reach
first page and price list=E2=80=9D *to this email and I will forward it str=
aight
away to you.

Thank you kindly for your time and consideration,

*Looking forward to working with you.*

*Kindest regards,*
*Weston Smith**| Business Analyst *
-----------------------------------------------------------------
*Note:* - I will be happy to *send a proposal and pricing* and details.
