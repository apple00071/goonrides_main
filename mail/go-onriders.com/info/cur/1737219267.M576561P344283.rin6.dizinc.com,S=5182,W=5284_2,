Hello.=20
I am interested in renting 2 Enfields together with a friend. Period about 3=
 weeks.=20

Is this possible without restrictions in the period February / March 2025?
Do we have to make reservations in advance, or are there always enough machi=
nes available?
Do we need extra documents, or is the international driver's license suffici=
ent?
Is there anything else to consider or do in advance?
We come from Germany and land and take off in Hyderabad.=20
