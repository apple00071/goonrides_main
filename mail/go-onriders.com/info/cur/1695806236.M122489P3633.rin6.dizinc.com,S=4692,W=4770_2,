<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>BLACKPINK are riding a fashion scooter SE3S at Amsterdam concert, the scooter SE3S looks like a luggage with wheels, it's made of high-tech materials, even two persons can sit on. More amazing, you could drive it in an airport, and board it on the plane as a carry-on luggage. It has many cool designs: LED breathing light, USB sockets, reverse gear. Do you have interest in this product?</p><p><img src="https://airwheel.net/ebike/airwheel-design-award-01.jpg" style="max-width:100%"></p><p><img src="https://www.airwheel.net/ebike/airwheel-scooter-suitcase-0220-37.gif" style="max-width:100%"></p>
