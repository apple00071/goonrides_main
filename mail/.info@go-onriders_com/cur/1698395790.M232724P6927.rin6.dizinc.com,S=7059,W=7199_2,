Hi,

I'm going to be in Hyderabad in December and i'm looking into option to
rent a motorcycle, probably Hymalian.

Could you help me with some info that i could not find on your website?

What is the price if i want to rent the motorcycle for 6-7 days?
Is there a limit to number of km that i can ride or extra price over the
limit?
Is there restriction where can ride? I want to go outside of Hyderabad, so
probably ride around Telangan.
Do you provide insurence for the bike?
What do i need to rent the motorcycle?
Is the weather in december good for motorcycle traveling?
Any tips for places worth visiting outside the large cities?
Any safety tips for motorcycle riders in India?


Thank you,
Marek
