Dear Shaik Mohammad,

Greetings from siliconIndia. This is Shashi Ranjan from siliconindia
Startup City Magazine from Bangalore. I am glad to inform you that we are
coming up with our Annual Edition on "10 Best Online Rental Startups -
2021"  As part of this feature, our Editorial team will honor "10 Best
Online Rental Startups - 2021".  Apart from this e-magazine will also have
regular features and opinions from Startup Industry Experts from Travel &
Tourism, Hospitality, Food & Beverages, Transportation, Apparel & Fashion,
E-commerce etc.

The phenomenon of renting is not new in India. Renting is economical and
also gets rid of the tension that comes bundled with ownership. There has
been a seismic shift towards the renting culture, especially among the
millennials. For individuals who had to change location every second or
third year even 20 years back had the need to take materials for everyday
use on rent. But the renting sector in India until a few years back was
completely fragmented. With the influx of several online rental companies,
it is taking a more structured shape, extending its reach and striving to
include all the merchandise from sharing financial resources to clothing
and accessories and in rare cases, even pets. Shared economy is the concept
that is used to address this aspect. It includes peer-to-peer
accommodation, peer-to-peer finance, music and video streaming, car sharing
and online stuffing. The sharing economy has the potential to generate $335
bn revenue in years to come.

A distinguished panel comprising accomplished CEOs, CXOs, VCs, and analysts
including SiliconIndia editorial board will decide the 10 Best Online
Rental Startups - 2021. We would like to feature "Go On Riders" in our
upcoming issue in "10 Best Online Rental Startups - 2021". We have reviewed
your company details and shortlisted. We do seek a nominal sponsorship
towards the reprints rights package.

BENEFITS:
1. Digital reprints rights of one-page Company profile developed by our
editorial team along with the CEO image which can be included in your
business promotions.
2. The profile will be promoted on our website as well as on various social
media platforms which will help you garner more visibility and make it easy
to share the link with your people.
3. The Certificate of Honor will be issued to recognize this honor, as
compliments of siliconindia magazine and you will have the right to include
this in all of your press releases/business promotions.

Please do let me know if you would be interested in this and I am candid to
having a discussion with you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Shashi Ranjan
Sr.Manager - Business Development
