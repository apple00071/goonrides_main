Hi, Considering equipment or other funding for your business? Looking at 

projects, inventory of pending staffing needs?  

It all takes capital, but this time maybe without all the traps and short-term 

offers you have been saturated with!

Are you tired of being fooled by those MCA salesmen?
 
You know the guy who has infuriated you with promised offer you a 5-year 

repayment but instead dropped a short-term working cap deal on your 

desk....yet again.  

Worse, talked you into a short-term deal with the promise to refy only to 

ghost you later?  Well, NOT here!

Prime Business our clients receive a fully amortized loan over 4 to 5 years 

for capital or equipment. Some industries like engineers, CPAs, or medical can 

get up to 8-year terms without an SBA.

No collateral
Monthly payments
No prepayment penalties
The very best rates
Never any application fees
Processing in 3-5 business days
